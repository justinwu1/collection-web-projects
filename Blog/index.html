                    <p class="article-text">
                        When I was a junior in high school, I needed to decide my major in college.
                        I was a typical kid who thought hacker was a super cool career, and just like all those classic
                        misconceptions about computer science, I thought Programmers === hackers! Then, I
                        filled my form with a "Computer Science" major. I decided to teach myself how to code
                        ASAP. I realized I misunderstand the Computer Science major after spending some time on coding
                        and
                        watching <a href="#">This youtube video</a>.
                        However, after spending some time on programming, I thought programmer is also a super cool
                        career!
                        So, I still decided to major in computer science at Brooklyn College.

                    <h2 class="article-header">How did I learn to code?</h2>

                    <h4 class="article-header">The Beginning</h4>
                    <p class="article-text">Before diving into it, I will put all the resources after this article. I
                        started with many famous
                        academic
                        websites like Freecodecamp, Codeacademy, Khanacademy
                        Lynda.com, Treehouse, W3School. In these websites, Freecodecamp was the best. Nevertheless, both
                        Freecodecamp and Codeacademy give you training wheels. They hold your hand and teach you how to
                        code. This form of teaching is not my taste, I prefer videos and project-based learning instead.
                        However, then I found CS50, which I still think is the best place, to begin with. CS50 is one of
                        the
                        most famous CS (Computer Science) class at Harvard.
                        They teach many programming languages like C#, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more. In
                        addition
                        to that, the Professor made his lecture super super super interesting, and project-based.
                        However,
                        the
                        course itself
                        help beginners
                        learn the fundamental of computer science. The fundamental is extremely important before diving
                        into
                        fields like Web Development, Machine Learnings or just any Computer Science fields. It's because
                        knowing "Why this happen" is more important than "How to make this happen".So, when people
                        encounter
                        bugs, they don't just search for the solution on StackOverflow. So, I encourage anyone who wants
                        to
                        start
                        coding, CS50
                        is a great place to go.

                    <p class="article-text">
                        After completing all the projects on CS50, I decided to dive in more deeper on Web Development.
                        However, I was procrastinating super hard, I lose my focus every second, and I swipe my phone
                        just
                        like every procrastinator. So I dropped my skills every few week and pick it up again. This
                        process
                        was extremely annoying, I learned almost nothing but the basic of Web Development. Then I
                        realized I
                        can't keep these anymore, I deleted every entertainment APP on my phone, and uninstall most of
                        the
                        games.
                        Then, I bought few courses on <a href="#">Udemy</a>. I had some skills on HTML5 and CSS3
                        already, so I build few projects among with the courses. If you're interested in my projects,
                        you
                        can
                        always check it out in my <a href="#">Portfolio Page</a> and <a href="#">Github</a>. Then, I
                        started
                        to land a job!
